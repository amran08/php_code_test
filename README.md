# PHP code test

Here I have tried to solve  three problems.
1. Printing depth of  keys of an associative array 
2. Printing depth of  keys of an associative array where nested objects can exist
3. Finding  ```least common ancestor (lca)``` between two nodes of a binary tree


## Getting Started

 1. `git clone https://github.com/amran08/php_code_test.git`
 2. `cd php_code_test`
 3. `composer install`
 4. `php app.php`
 

### Prerequisites

composer and PHP 

## Memory and Runtime for Problem 3 

 ##### Memory   
      Worst:  O(n)
      Avg :   O(log n)

##### Runtime
      Worst: O(n^2)
      Avg:   O((log n)^2)
 


## Running the tests
